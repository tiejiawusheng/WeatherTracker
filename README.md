Project Overview

This project is an iOS application designed to display weather information for a given city. Users can search for cities and
view details such as temperature, humidity, UV index, and more. It fetches data from a weather API and updates the UI accordingly.

Key Features and Implementation
	1.	MVVM Architecture:
	•	The project is structured using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for clean separation of concerns and better testability.
	•	The Model layer handles the API responses and data parsing.
	•	The ViewModel layer processes and prepares data for the UI.
	•	The View layer consists of SwiftUI components for a modern, declarative UI.
	2.	Weather API Integration:
	•	Uses a weather API to fetch real-time weather information.
	•	Networking is handled using URLSession or a third-party library like Alamofire.
	3.	Search Functionality:
	•	Includes a search bar for users to look up weather details by city.
	•	Implements live or debounce-based search functionality.
	4.	Asynchronous Image Loading:
	•	Downloads and displays weather icons asynchronously using SwiftUI’s AsyncImage or a custom image loader with caching support.
	5.	Responsive UI:
	•	Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
	•	Supports light and dark modes for enhanced user experience.
	6.	Error Handling:
	•	Displays user-friendly error messages for network issues or invalid API responses.

 Technologies Used
	•	SwiftUI: For building the UI in a declarative way.
	•	Combine: For handling asynchronous data streams and state management.
	•	URLSession: For making network requests.
	•	Local Storage (Optional): To cache recent searches or weather data for offline usage.

 This project demonstrates clean code practices, modern SwiftUI development, and integration of third-party services (like APIs) to provide a smooth user experience.
